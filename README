I use this repository to track changes to the random scripts and utilities I
use on various machines. Note that development to some of these scripts happens
in a private repo, so you may be looking at an older copy here. If in doubt,
email me and I can provide you with the latest version. Some of these scripts
are example code or my own experimentation, so yes, some of this code has no
purpose.

bashd.sh - A script for connecting bash to a local port. Handy for probing
    environments where you don't have a PTY.
config/ - Directory for containing my shared configuration settings.
cub.py - Messy and inaccurate C linter.
find-broken.sh - A script for finding broken symlinks.
fwdmail.py - A script for forwarding your local mail to an external address.
generate-passwd - A script for generating random passwords.
internal/ - A directory for scripts for managing operations specific to this
    repository.
manage-kernels - Script for uninstalling Linux kernels.
misc/ - A directory for miscellaneous half-finished bits or tools that I don't
    actually deploy anywhere, but like to track changes to.
misc/alloc/ - Fragments of a half-finished allocation library.
misc/alloc-monitor.c - Yet another LD_PRELOAD hack for instrumenting calls to
    malloc and free.
misc/balloon.c - A memory balloon application.
misc/error-handling.c - An example (experiment?) of out-of-line error handling
    in C.
misc/fuckit-cc - A script for violently suppressing errors in your C code.
    Considered harmful.
misc/is-bound.c - Program for checking whether a socket is currently bound.
misc/linked_list.[ch] - An implementation of a linked list in C. This was some
    code from when I was learning C. If you want a linked list, you are
    probably better served by rolling your own.
misc/lock-monitor/ - A tool for catching deadlock and livelock issues.
misc/lubuntu/ - Some files related to setting up a nicer configuration on
    Lubuntu.
misc/macros.h - A header file of handy C macros.
misc/mem-exec.c - Utility for testing executability of memory regions.
misc/memset.c - Various memset implementations.
misc/overloading.c - Function overloading in C. Betcha thought it was
    impossible.
misc/probe-mmap.c - Determine the dimensions of your mmap region.
misc/puts-ldpreload-example.c - A nice simple example of an LD_PRELOAD hack.
    These tricks are useful for instrumenting closed source programs.
misc/ram-churn.c - A utility for pushing all running processes' pages to disk
    (i.e. evicting them from RAM).
misc/sizeofs.sh - A script for doing more advanced sizeof operations on C
    entities that are not known at compile time.
misc/stack-smash-hello-world.c - Hello world written using a stack smashing
    attack.
prefix - Preface each output line from a command with some given text.
timestamp - Timestamp console stdout.

I use this repository to track changes to the random scripts and utilities I
use on various machines. Note that development to some of these scripts happens
in a private repo, so you may be looking at an older copy here. If in doubt,
email me and I can provide you with the latest version.

has-changed.sh  A bash script for monitoring updates to a given webpage.
MediaWatch.py   A python script I use for monitoring directories on various
                servers that I administer. It's designed to be run as a cron
                job that scans a set of directories and emails you any changes
                observed since its last scan.

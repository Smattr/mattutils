This repository contains a script I use on various servers for monitoring
directories and notifying relevant users of file changes. It's all pretty
straightforward python code. All code in this repository is in the Public
Domain. Note that active development of this script actually happens in a
privately hosted repository, so if you're after the latest version of this
script please contact me at matthew.fernandez@gmail.com and I'll be happy to
pass it on.

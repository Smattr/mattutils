I use this repository to track changes to the random scripts and utilities I
use on various machines. Note that development to some of these scripts happens
in a private repo, so you may be looking at an older copy here. If in doubt,
email me and I can provide you with the latest version. Some of these scripts
are example code or my own experimentation, so yes, some of this code has no
purpose. Unless otherwise noted, all code in this repository is licensed under
a CC BY 3.0 licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). You are free
to use this code for any purpose provided you retain attribution to the
original author, Matthew Fernandez <matthew.fernandez@gmail.com>.

config/ - Directory for containing my shared configuration settings.
fwdmail.py - A script for forwarding your local mail to an external address.
generate-passwd - A script for generating random passwords.
github-ls.sh - A script for listing the names of all your github repos. I use
    this to generate a manifest to pass to my backup script.
giveem.sh - Creates a setuid binary for a given shell command. This is a quick
    hack to give someone else the ability to run commands as you. Handy on a
    system where you're collaborating with someone and neither of you have
    sudo. Obviously it's pretty easy to shoot yourself in the foot with this
    one, so tread carefully.
has-changed.sh - A bash script for monitoring updates to a given webpage.
have-lib.sh - A bash script to check for the existence of a library (handy for
    Makefiles).
internal/ - A directory for scripts for managing operations specific to this
    repository.
internal/install.sh - A script to symlink all the relevant bits I use into my
    ~/bin directory.
misc/ - A directory for miscellaneous half-finished bits or tools that I don't
    actually deploy anywhere, but like to track changes to.
misc/alloc-monitor.c - Yet another LD_PRELOAD hack for instrumenting calls to
    malloc and free.
misc/cat.bf - An implementation of cat in brainfuck for fun and profit.
misc/linked_list.[ch] - An implementation of a linked list in C. This was some
    code from when I was learning C. If you want a linked list, you are
    probably better served by rolling your own.
misc/lock-monitor/ - A tool for catching deadlock and livelock issues.
misc/memset.c - Various memset implementations.
misc/puts-ldpreload-example.c - A nice simple example of an LD_PRELOAD hack.
    These tricks are useful for instrumenting closed source programs.
misc/ram-churn.c - A utility for pushing all running processes' pages to disk
    (i.e. evicting them from RAM).
misc/RTL8192CU_kernel_2.6.38.patch - If you have a Realtek RTL8192CU wireless
    device and have attempted to use it on Linux, you will have discovered that
    the Realtek driver doesn't compile under any kernel after 2.6.35. This patch
    fixes the driver for 2.6.38. If you've got the RAR archive from Realtek, the
    best approach is to extract it, run the install.sh script, when it fails
    modify the script to comment out the tar zxvf line, apply the patch, re-run
    the script. There's an in-kernel driver in the staging tree scheduled for
    inclusion in the 2.6.39 so this patch shouldn't be relevant for long.
misc/signal-sniffer.c - A program for determining what signals it is receiving.
    Handy for situations where an external program is emitting a signal that
    you need to diagnose.
misc/smartquote.c - Code golf with a program designed to convert single quotes
    into smart quotes. Can you do better?
misc/stack-smash-hello-world.c - Hello world written using a stack smashing
    attack.
mediawatch.py - A python script I use for monitoring directories on various
    servers that I administer. It's designed to be run as a cron job that scans
    a set of directories and notifies you of any changes observed since its
    last scan.
mplayerfs - Wrapper for starting mplayer in full screen mode and accounting for
    network playback.
npq.sh - Check a print queue and send a notification to the desktop.
remove-ubuntu-games.sh - Shortcut for removing all the default Ubuntu games.
reset-perms.sh - Script for reseting the permissions on a folder recursively.
    This is awkward to do with chmod when you want to set different permissions
    for the directories and files.
sendmail.py - Script for sending mail from the command line. I got tired of
    configuring Postfix and other MTAs, when all I wanted to do was script a
    simple email.
toggle-screensaver - A script for enabling and disabling the Gnome screensaver.

I use this repository to track changes to the random scripts and utilities I
use on various machines. Note that development to some of these scripts happens
in a private repo, so you may be looking at an older copy here. If in doubt,
email me and I can provide you with the latest version.

config - Directory for containing my shared configuration settings.
generate-passwd - A script for generating random passwords.
has-changed.sh - A bash script for monitoring updates to a given webpage.
misc/ - A directory for miscellaneous half-finished bits or tools that I don't
    actually deploy anywhere, but like to track changes to.
misc/cat.bf - An implementation of cat in brainfuck for fun and profit.
misc/ram-churn.c - A utility for pushing all running processes' pages to disk
    (i.e. evicting them from RAM).
misc/RTL8192CU_kernel_2.6.38.patch - If you have a Realtek RTL8192CU wireless
    device and have attempted to use it on Linux, you will have discovered that
    the Realtek driver doesn't compile under any kernel after 2.6.35. This patch
    fixes the driver for 2.6.38. If you've got the RAR archive from Realtek, the
    best approach is to extract it, run the install.sh script, when it fails
    modify the script to comment out the tar zxvf line, apply the patch, re-run
    the script. There's an in-kernel driver in the staging tree scheduled for
    inclusion in the 2.6.39 so this patch shouldn't be relevant for long.
MediaWatch.py - A python script I use for monitoring directories on various
    servers that I administer. It's designed to be run as a cron job that scans
    a set of directories and emails you any changes observed since its last
    scan.
playtime - A script for playing all your videos on random. Like watching TV
    without ads :)
toggle-screensaver - A script for enabling and disabling the Gnome screensaver.

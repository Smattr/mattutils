The magic I have that triggers syntax highlighting in be comments no longer
seems to work on newer Ubuntu. I suspect it's related to a differing Vim version
rather than anything kernel-related itself, but haven't investigated yet.
Manually setting be syntax works fine, so I don't think it's the syntax file
itself.

Synecdoche now has a production toolchain derived from Clang/LLVM r292090. This
aligns with Clang 5.0.0 which has yet to be released. Though this isn't from a
stable channel, I've so far found this toolchain to be very stable and produces
high quality code. Looks like the current distro lives to fight another day.

Note, the old toolchain is currently retained if there's any need to do
development on it, but it is expected that any development on Clang/LLVM itself
would involve patches against the latest, rather than 3.7.0.

The machine, synecdoche, has an out-of-band Clang toolchain that was built from
source and has become the ad hoc default for building C/C++ projects. It claims
to be version 3.7.0, but directory naming indicates it was built from source
from a random Subversion commit. I don't recall what flags it was built with,
but it seems to be some sort of debug configuration; it takes a long time to
compile and produces very large binaries encumbered with all sorts of debug
info.

The machine has no need for this kind of toolchain and could easily live with a
standard production Clang. It should be replaced with a production compiler. If
there are no external constraints, a reasonable alternative might be a
dist-upgrade given the state and purpose of the machine.

Investigating this more thoroughly, the problem seems to stem from branching.
The previous procedure (documented for posterity) was:

.. code-block:: sh

    # Convert hg -> git
    mkdir checkout
    cd checkout
    git init
    hg-fast-export -r /path/to/hg/repo

    # Convert git -> hg
    hg clone /path/to/git/repo

Mercurial attaches branch names to changesets. That is, commits explicitly live
on particular branches. Git doesn't have this concept. As a result, the branch
names are lost when doing the round trip. For example, in the passwand repo
there was a merge from the 'crewrite' branch back into 'default'. All changesets
on the 'crewrite' branch end up with different hashes after the round trip.

Not clear how or whether to resolve this. It might be simpler to blow away the
remaining Mercurial repos and replace them with Git.

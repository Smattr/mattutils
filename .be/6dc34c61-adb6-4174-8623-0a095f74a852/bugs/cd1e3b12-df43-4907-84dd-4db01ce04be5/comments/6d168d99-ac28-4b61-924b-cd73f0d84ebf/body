I've had a plan for a script to sync Git/Hg/etc repositories for a while, but it
seems there's now a more pressing need for this. My old workflow for doing this
has apparently bit rotted. Conversion from Hg to Git is still possible, but the
other direction seems error prone. In particular, it does not seem possible to
use the previous workflow in a round trip and get the same commit hashes back. I
managed to screw this up in the passwand repo, where I did some work in a Git
checkout instead of the canonical Hg source.

I think the long term solution to this frustration is to migrate all Hg repos to
Git and abandon Hg. It's time to accept that Git won the war.

While trying to alias Bugs Everywhere to trigger automatic Vim syntax
highlighting, I ran into unexpected problems. Executing the resulting
symlink hangs with odd symptoms: no CPU usage, stable memory usage,
signals blocked. Given the tricks we're playing, stack overflow would
be comprehensible, but that's clearly not what's happening here.

So far no clues, but I haven't tried any serious debugging yet.

It occurs to me as I write this that I've never plumbed reroute to a
Python script. It's possible there are unintended interactions between
the reroute environment and the target environment. It may be possible
to debug this by substituting exec for whatever subprocess ops we're
doing.

Of course, a more principled solution to reroute would be a native
application with a Lua-based DSL config language, but who has the time.

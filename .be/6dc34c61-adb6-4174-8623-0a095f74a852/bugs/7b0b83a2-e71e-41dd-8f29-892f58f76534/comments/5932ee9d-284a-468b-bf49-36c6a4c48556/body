A couple of tools I run seem to deliberately double-fork, not to
daemonize, but to escape being reaped when the parent exits or is
killed. This is rude and undesirable, but they don't seem to expose
options for changing this behaviour. These could be wrapped in a monitor
process that forwards signals and uses a process group (or a PID
namespace) to contain, monitor, and reap the children. Basically
something that acts like a more generalised version of init. Some
investigation is required to see if an OTS tool exists to do this.
